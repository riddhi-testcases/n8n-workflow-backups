# 📰 News Summarization Workflow with n8n + Nhost (Hasura)

This repository contains an **n8n workflow** that automates the process of fetching news articles, summarizing them using an AI model via OpenRouter, analyzing sentiment, and storing the processed data in a PostgreSQL database powered by **Nhost + Hasura**.

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

1. **Trigger:** The workflow starts manually via the "Test workflow" trigger node.
2. **HTTP Request (NewsAPI):** Fetches top headlines from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org).
3. **Code Node 1:** Generates UUIDs and extracts required fields from the fetched articles.
4. **Code Node 2:** Prepares the content string for summarization.
5. **HTTP Request (OpenRouter):** Sends article content to OpenRouter for summarization and sentiment analysis.
6. **Code Node 3:** Parses AI output — includes summary, sentiment, etc.
7. **Merge Node:** Merges original and AI-enriched data.
8. **Final Code Node:** Formats data into a GraphQL-compatible format.
9. **HTTP Request (Hasura/Nhost):** Sends the data using a GraphQL mutation to Nhost's Hasura backend.
